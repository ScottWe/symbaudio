# A collection of audio scripts.

SymbAudio brings symbolic computation to audio processing.
All top level scripts within `symbaudio/` are meant as stand-alone applications.
Each directory under `symbaudio/` is submodule, providing some set of losely related featured.
The `test/` directory mirrors the structure and `symbaudio/`, and provides unit tests for each submodule.
The `results/` directory contains experimental data produced by the SymbAudio suite.

## Prerequisites

This project requires,

- Python 3
- [sympy](https://www.sympy.org)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

All required libraries are distributed as part of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

## Ownership of Audio Data

The SymbAudio benchmark was created using audio made available through the [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/).
Ownership is not claimed of any of these pieces, and each piece has been redistributed without modification to their original audio.
Each audio file is named with its original title and artist.
These names may be found in all raw data dumps.
Full licensing details of each piece, along with information on the associated composer, may be found at the [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/).

The dataset is 3GB in compressed form, and is therefore not avaiable (at present).
